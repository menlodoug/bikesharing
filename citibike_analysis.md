# Let's Share an Iowa Bike Ride! Are You In?

The objective of the Module 14 Tableau Challenge was to look at data from NYC's **Citi Bike** and determine the viability of a similar bike share system in Des Moines, Iowa.  Upon researching the Des Moines market, I found that BCycle has been operating a bike share system in the metro Des Moines area for several years now.  The BCycle system was developed by the **Trek Bicycle Company**, headquartered in Waterloo, WI, and has pioneered bike sharing in a number of markets around the country.  The **BCycle** operation in Des Moines is run by an independent company, **Street Collective**.  In the Western-most city of Iowa, Council Bluffs, that city is serviced by another BCycle operator, **Heartland BCycle**, based just across the state border in Omaha, NE.

It might be possible to buy out the **BCycle** in Des Moines, or partner with them, but I decided that we should explore other options in the state of Iowa.  I took a look at the largest cities in the state as well as the largest college communities.  Bike sharing has been a very popular and fast growing transportation alternative on college campuses.  The colleges in Des Moines and Council Bluffs are covered by **BCycle**, but the other institutions around the state could benefit from a bike-sharing system, particularly the largest two, Iowa State University in Ames and the University of Iowa in Iowa City.

In the course of my research, I found a company that specializes in turn-key bike share solutions for colleges and universities.  The name of the company is **On Bike Share**, located in Pawtucket, RI.  I have a page in the Tableau story featuring their web site.

The first page of my story shares an Iowa-specific bike picture and an image of a **BCycle** bike share dock.

Page 2 is the **Citi Bike** web page detailing their history and journey as the nation's largest bike share system.

Page 3 is a humorous YouTube video giving some tips on using the **Citi Bike** system.

Page 4 provides some key data on the **Citi Bike** NYC operation for August of 2019.  It includes average trip duration (provided in minutes) by age of rider, gender breakdown, subscriber/casual customer mix, and a map showing station utilization in the system.

Page 5 shows the system usage of **Citi Bike** NYC for each hour of the day for the month so you can easily see their peak hours.

On page 6, I have provided a graphic that shows the growth of bike share systems worldwide, for the years between 2005 and 2018.  The sources for the graphic were StatistaCharts and **MetroBike**'s Bike-Sharing blog.

The charts on the next page come from NACTO (*National Association of City Transportation Officials*) and show the growth in bike-sharing from 2010 to 2018.  The second bar chart also shows the major system operators' contribution to that growth and the overall mix.

Also from NACTO, the two charts on the following page show the variation in # of trips by time of day and also by day of the week, helping to illuminate peak usage in a bike-sharing day and week.

Page 9 shows the uses behind people's decisions to use a bike-sharing system, as documented by NACTO.

Page 10 takes a CSV file provided by NACTO and plots the data using Tableau to show the largest bike-sharing systems in the U.S., as of the end of 2016.  You can see that, as of that date, **Des Moines BCycle** had 100 bikes operating in their fleet.  **Heartland BCycle** in Omaha, NE (servicing Council Bluffs, IA) had 180.

On page 11, I plotted data on **Des Moines BCycle**'s operation obtained from the Bureau of Transportaion Services web site.  This very current 2020 data shows dock locations, along with number of bikes.  DesMoines BCycle has grown to a fleet of 219 bicycles.

Since **BCycle** is the current leader in the Iowa market, the next page features their web site and shows a map of their numerous and growing locations across the country.

Next we get into a look at demographic information for the state of Iowa.  Page 13 shows the top 11 cities (by population) in the state, with the bubble size dependent upon population.  Similarly, page 14 shows the top 12 colleges/universities in Iowa along with their student populations.

On the following page, I cite a 2017 article from Forbes magazine, promoting the viability of college campus bike share systems.  The logos of the top candidates likely to benefit from this type of operation are featured at the top.

Page 16 is the web site of **On Bike Share**, a company offering a turn-key system to set up a bike-share on a college campus.

Page 17 is my set of recommendations to the investors.  These include: 

1. Des Moines and Council Bluffs are eliminated from consideration of a startup, due to the presence of **BCyle** in Des Moines and Omaha, NE (sister to Council Bluffs). 
2. Look into **BCycle** partnership/franchise opportunities in other Iowa cities where **BCycle** not currently operating.
3. Look at possibility of buying out existing **Des Moines BCycle** operator.
4. Prioritize consideration of unserved college communities.  Iowa State (in Ames) and U of Iowa (Iowa City) have the largest student populations.
5. Investigate **On Bike Share**'s turn key program that has been designed for college communities.  Also consider other similar solutions.

Page 18 addresses a current national and international concern - Covid-19.  A couple of charts from NABSA (North American Bike Share Association) are featured, showing the number of systems that have closed temporarily as a result of the pandemic and another that shows the percentage that are offering discounted or free services (much of this generosity being directed towards first responders and health care providers).

The last page is a YouTube video from NACTO designed to stimulate conversation about how bike-sharing systems can be part of a community improving and enriching the quality of life for all the stakeholders involved.
